"I tend to like to do a bit of everything except programming, but I can pull through when needed. Recently I've been doing audio and game design, but I can also do art if needed. Really, I'd say I'm just something of the creative/idea guy.",
"im a 1st year college student who's interested in working more on game dev. I think that's where the 'idea' part stems from, I feel like I've always been coming up with ideas for game mods or something when I was younger, but over time I've wanted to create a bit more. Throughout highschool I got things like aseprite and fl studio and had a bit a fun with those, and now, I've started working on projects! I've always been inspired by indie games like touhou, and the idea of expressing yourself or ideas through video games, which is really what I like to pursue.",
"It actually combines two different game ideas, one being a timed cannon shot type game (I compared this to certain kirby minigames when communicating it to my team) and a bullet hell-like akin to regular touhou that involves dodging birds. I essentially was the one who planted the seed for the project to get started, and my team and I have helped it grow.",
"Let me think about this one... I'd say considering how it involves a lot of birds flying at you, I'd describe it as a parrot even though there's no parrots involved. This is due to my experiences with watching parrots fly in large flocks very noisily across the sky which I think fits the bill quite well with what the game's going for. The amazona parrot to be specific",
"I'd say being happy with what I have and working efficiently, for example maybe a sound effect I made didn't perfectly fit what I had in mind, but so long as it works well for the game I'd say it would be fine for the sake of priority.",
"No problem, i'm looking forward to them too haha"

"What is your specialty when it comes to development? Are you a programmer? Do you focus on the presentation such as music or artwork? Or are you a renaisance man and just do a bit of everything?",
"Can you tell us a bit about yourself, 'idea guy'?",
"What's the game you're making like? How have your ideas shaped it?",
"Would you consider yourself a fan of birds? What is your favorite, if you have any?",
"If you had to describe your game as a species of bird, which would it be?",
"What an excellent bird. Lastly, what is the hardest part of the game development process for you?",
"Alright. Thank you for your time. I look forward to the 'bird bullets'!",
