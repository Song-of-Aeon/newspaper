"Hmm I mostly do art- or well just design i guess- i love when a game looks pretty. though for this one project im kind of attempting voice acting- just for fun.",
"HAI!!! IM Z (ZzzZooie)!! i do art and i just really like drawing girls !!!! ive been drawing for,, a  few years now. ive never dabbled into fanart or anything until recently since touhou characters hit different to draw :). these game jams have been my real first time getting into game development and its inspiring, im hoping one day ill start my own lil group. but yea thats all i think i have to say abt myself.",
"really just trying to get the whole picture? like putting everything together i would say is the most difficult part. game development takes a lot of you know willingness to, whats the word- basically, sometimes you gotta give up stuff that you want for the whole thing to work out, and i can be a bit stubborn so; so id say giving up some creative control is kinda difficult, but expected.",
"!!! im more of a bug person but id say my favorite bird is,,, the zebra finch! they're so cute and small and silly. birds are ok but bugs are 100% better.",
"no because bugs eat birds, so its fair game. plus in the end!! everything goes to the bugs.",
"the game im working on is called fowl detective satori!! basically like a wheres waldo type of deal. you gotta bunch of birds but the stinnky mamizou is hiding among them! but as of course- mamizou is basically like a master at disguise! so you gotta really look close to find her in that darn pack of birds! its simple but who doesnt like a small time waster? plus the bird designs are soooo cute i think its a bit fun and silly so i hope people who play it will enjoy it too! all your favorite toohoo birds will be there! i think. heh."
