"Ten-time Touhou jam host, two-time animator of Yuuka sipping Estus tea, ordinary developer of 3D bullet hells turned software engineer turned fulltime developer of 3D bullet hells, artist of Flandre holding a COBOL book, purveyor of obscure and mostly useless tank facts, rak. wdym 'facade' i am definitely a bird look how shiny my feathers are.",
"One day long ago when the only jam hosts were Brian and Texel, Texel put out a call for volunteers to help with organizing jams. I'd been participating in jams and answering questions about jam rules for a while at that point and couldn't think of anyone else who might volunteer first, so I did. Texel closed that call for volunteers terrifyingly quickly and I've been trapped here ever since.",
"Enforcing rules, maybe...? Chastising people for infractions is one of those unpleasant but necessary things for community and event running. A close second might be manually tabulating jam scores at the end of the voting period to check the rankings that itch.io calculates; fortunately we worked out a faster method since.",
"Getting to see what everyone else has made at the end. You'd think there'd only be so many ways to interpret Touhou into fangames but the jammers always come up with new ones, and in working periods that would make most professional developers nervous too.",
"The dev team/company name I operate under is 'Noetic Nightjar'. 'Noetic' because probably I think too much about design details, 'Nightjar' because I like birds and it's a bird with a name that alliterates well and nightjars have funny mouths that look tiny when closed but are actually really wide when opened.",
"If you regard the jam games as the real stars...birds...? of the show, the jams are more like a well-tended yard with birdfeeders. If it has to be a bird though, maybe I'd say kakapo. Kakapos are neat.",
