"The most difficult part of gamedev is managing my time, because I am a lazy bones who does a lot last minute! Another difficult (or maybe challenging) part is adapting the art style to the needs of the game direction, but it's also the most rewarding part because I enjoy being versatile.",
"Between our gamedev duo, my boyfriend (our programming and writing half) is a huge fan of birds and has a growing interest in birdwatching, and through him I've gained a new interest in birds as well. They're mysterious creatures. I'm partial to herons and egrets, since there are some very large, majestic ones living quietly in the river in my hometown.",
"Our game is a dating sim featuring five Touhou bird girls. We're hoping to take a silly, parody-like approach to classic anime and dating sim tropes with the twist of all characters being very birdlike in behavior (a crow girl rummaging through your morning garbage, a sparrow girl making you a bento of worms, etc) while also providing just enough emotional depth to not make it a complete joke, but rather a fun and enjoyable experience for all the people who complain about too many visual novels in game jams ðŸ˜‰ We're paying tribute especially to visual novels by Key (Kanon, Air, Clannad) and also a VN for the Nintendo DS that I got for Christmas when I was 10. Each girl is a different type of bird (so it's not filled with just crow tengu!) and one in particular might be a little unexpected. They all have both girl and bird behaviors for fans of both to enjoy.",
"Our game is, according to our programmer, 'uhhh, i don't know. hahaha. a penguin'."],
