"i've always worked as the artist, haha. i've done a variety of assets like pixel art, vn portraits and backgrounds. besides working on teams, i've also been developing a small solo project, of which i'm handling everything.",
"hmm, i guess to gain more experience with teams i suppose? i hadn't joined any teams in my first jam, so I thought 'eh, why not?'. I'm also fairly confident in delivering art assets quickly, so that was another factor. ah, to add on, this would be my second jam.",
"Hm... Well besides creating art, I've been immersed in all sorts of digital forms of creativity for a while now. Programming is an especially recent one, and while it can be frustrating, I really enjoy the process of problem solving and making improvisations on the fly. I've also been dipping my toes into composing, though I would say I'm at a very rookie level, haha.",
"Hm... everything, really. You have to make sure the code works properly, for one. But then you also have to design the game to be fun, and I think that requires a pretty different skillset from just coding. You also have to make sure the art assets are consistent (or at the very least, of a certain quality). the same goes for music. and sound effects are very important for player feedback. Not to mention, marketing and everything... It's a lot to take in in general.",
"Oh, definitely. While I did have some boilerplate and code references at the ready, piecing together a prototype still took quite a while. The art assets did go smoothly, but that's just because I'm an artist by trade. And I'm still trying to balance the game, and I've yet to start on the music and sound effects. Though the fact that I have complete creative direction for this, including what characters to put, really motivates me to see this to completion.",
"...I'm not sure, haha. I realise that there's precisely only one bird in my game. But there's a lot of flying (I think) and dodging rocks (especially). It also features my favourites characters, Megumu and Momoyo.",
"Actually, I'm more of an aquatic creatures enjoyer. But I do enjoy my fair share of birds as well. I really like quails and baby chicks. They're so round and cute! I also love baby penguins for the same reason. And penguins in general, too. I went to see some penguins at a bird park once, and the way they kept diving into the water at this exact same location every few minutes was really funny to me.",
"It would be... a bird of prey. Any bird of prey will do, really.",
"No problem! Good luck with the rest of the interviews (and your jam game [newspaper] in general)"

"What is your name?",
"So leaf, as you said before the interview, you've worked across multiple teams this jam. What's your role been for these teams?",
"That's quite a bit of work! Why did you decide to work with multiple teams this jam?",
"Can you tell us a bit more about yourself? Feel free to say as much as you want.",
"You've worked in a lot of different production fields then. In game development, what do you think the most difficult part of the process is?",
"While making your solo project, have you felt the challenges you described in your previous answer?",
"Can you tell us a bit about your solo project? Will the bird enjoyers be satisfied?",
"Would you consider yourself a fan of birds? What is your favorite, if you have any?",
"If you had to describe your game as a species of bird, which would it be?",
"Feisty. That's everything. Thank your for your time!"
